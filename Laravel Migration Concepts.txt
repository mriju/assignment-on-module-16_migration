Laravel Migration Concepts

Task 1:
Create a new Laravel project named "MigrationAssignment" using the Laravel command-line interface.

-- composer create-project laravel/laravel MigrationAssignment
-- cd MigrationAssignment
-- php artisan serve


Task 2:
Within the project, create a new migration file named "create_products_table" that will be responsible for creating a table called "products" in the database. The "products" table should have the following columns:

id: an auto-incrementing integer and primary key.
name: a string column to store the product name.
price: a decimal column to store the product price.
description: a text column to store the product description.
created_at: a timestamp column to store the creation date and time.
updated_at: a timestamp column to store the last update date and time.


-- php artisan make:migration create_products_table
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name',50);
    $table->string('price',50);
    $table->string('description', 2000);            
    $table->timestamp('created_at')->useCurrent();
    $table->timestamp('updated_at')->useCurrent()->useCurrentOnUpdate();

Task 3:
After creating the migration file, run the migration to create the "products" table in the database.

-- php artisan migrate

Task 4:
Modify the existing migration file "create_products_table" to add a new column called "quantity" to the "products" table. The "quantity" column should be an integer column and allow null values.

-- php artisan make:migration add_column_to_products_table
 	$table->after('description', function (Blueprint $table){
	    $table->integer('quantity')->nullable();
	});


Task 5:
Create a new migration file named "add_category_to_products_table" that will be responsible for adding a new column called "category" to the "products" table. The "category" column should be a string column with a maximum length of 50 characters.

-- php artisan make:migration add_category_to_products_table
 	$table->after('quantity', function (Blueprint $table){
	    $table->string('category', 50);
	});


Task 6:
After creating the new migration file, run the migration to add the "category" column to the "products" table.

-- php artisan migrate


Task 7:
Create a new migration file named "create_orders_table" that will be responsible for creating a table called "orders" in the database. The "orders" table should have the following columns:


id: an auto-incrementing integer and primary key.
product_id: an unsigned integer column to establish a foreign key relationship with the "id" column of the "products" table.
quantity: an integer column to store the quantity of products ordered.
created_at: a timestamp column to store the creation date and time.
updated_at: a timestamp column to store the last update date and time.

-- php artisan make:migration create_orders_table
   
   $table->unsignedBigInteger('product_id');
   $table->integer('quantity');
   $table->foreign('product_id')->references('id')->on('products')
   ->restrictOnDelete();
   ->cascadeOnUpdate();
   $table->timestamp('created_at')->useCurrent();
   $table->timestamp('updated_at')->useCurrent()->useCurrentOnUpdate();




Task 8:
After creating the migration file for the "orders" table, run the migration to create the "orders" table in the database.

-- php artisan migrate
